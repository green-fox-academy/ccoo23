// Write a program that stores 3 sides of a cuboid as variables (floats)
// The program should write the surface area and volume of the cuboid like:
//chang 3 kuan 2 gao 1
var l = 3 ; w = 2 ; h = 1
var s = 2*(l*w+w*h+h*l);
var v = l*w*h;

console.log("Surface Area: " + s);
console.log("Volume: " + v);
